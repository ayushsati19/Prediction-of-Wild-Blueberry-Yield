# Prediction-of-Wild-Blueberry-Yield

# Blueberry Yield Prediction Dataset
This is a machine learning competition where the objective is to predict the yield of blueberries based on various features. The dataset used for this competition was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction Dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset for this competition consists of two files: train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv file contains the training dataset, while the test.csv file contains the test dataset. The target variable is the yield, and the other features include information on weather, location, and soil quality, among others. The feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original dataset.

# Files
train.csv: The training dataset with 120000 rows and 10 columns. The columns include the yield and other features used for prediction.

test.csv: The test dataset with 80000 rows and 9 columns. The columns include all the features used for prediction except for the yield, which is what needs to be predicted.

sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file in the correct format.
